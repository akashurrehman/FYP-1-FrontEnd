###  `Description`
This repository contains a Java Spring application that serves as a template for building web applications using the Spring framework. It provides a basic setup and structure for creating RESTful APIs or web applications with Java.

### `Features`
Spring Boot: The application is built using the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring applications.
RESTful API: The application is designed to create RESTful APIs, allowing you to expose endpoints to perform various operations.
Database Integration: It includes integration with a database system which is rdf or ontology for data storage.
Dependency Management: Dependency management is handled using Maven, making it easy to add and manage external libraries or frameworks.
Unit Testing: The application includes a testing framework (JUnit) for writing unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.
Logging: It incorporates logging functionality (e.g., using Log4j or Logback) to track and analyze application events.
Security: The application can be configured to handle authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
Deployment: It provides instructions for deploying the application to different environments, such as local development.

### `Getting Started`
